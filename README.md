## Human-centred Evaluations of User Feedback-based Counterfactual Explanations (UFCE)

Welcome to the GitHub repository for HCEvaluations4UFCE, this repository presents the solutions to conduct human-centred evaluations of counterfactual explainer methods.

#### Overview

In the context of Human-centred XAI, an interactive web-based game framework is designed calling it Alien Nutri-Solver. This game framework encompass a virtual domain-agnostic seeting including combinatorial tasks. The tasks are solved by the help of counterfactual explanations, providing an opportunity to analyse the task performance of users, hence, paving the way to assess the goodness of explanations. A post-game survey is integrated to record the user responses on the Likert-scale about the Understaing, Satisfaction, Actionability, Confidence, and Trust in the provided explanations. The game is deployed on our web server, and you can access it [here](http://85.235.144.146:8888/index.html).

### Key Objectives

This research mainly focuses on:

1. **Understanding Human Comprehension:** Explore how human learners comprehend AI models using XAI tools.
2. **Satisfaction:** Evaluate the satisfaction level of user on the counterfactual XAI tool.
3. **Trust:** Evaluate the trust of users on the provided explanations by the counterfactual XAI tool.

### HCEvaluations4UFCE in Action

HCEvaluations4UFCE is demonstrated through a game-inspired virtual use case. In this scenario, learners engage in combinatorial problem-solving tasks. The goal is to enhance problem-solving skills and deepen understanding of complex concepts. The game is named ExpGame and can be found at this link[click here()]
